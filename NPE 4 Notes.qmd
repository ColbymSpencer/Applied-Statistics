Informative = r-squared value

𝛽

#### Assumptions for a Linear Model:

-   Linearity: Residual vs Fitted; no pattern

-   Independence of Residuals: Read study design

-   Homoscedasticity: Scale-Location graph, we expect a horizontal line

-   Normality of Residuals: QQ plot is linear

Based on the description of the data we have no reason to suspect a dependency\
between the observations, but we do not have enough information to be sure that\
the observations are independent. The diagnostic plots don’t point to a clear\
violation of the assumptions. The residuals appear approximately normal on a QQ\
plot, and neither the residual plot nor the scale-location plot show any clear trend.

#### Example Conclusions

At the 5% significance level we cannot find enough evidence for an interaction between pH and temperature (𝑇𝑑𝑓∶121 = 0.061, p = 0.952). Based on this sample we cannot prove that the effect of pH would change when the temperature changes.

At the 5% significance level we don’t find enough evidence to conclude that the effect of biodiversity differs between forests of a different age (𝐹𝑑𝑓∶2,30 = 0.198, p = 0.822).
